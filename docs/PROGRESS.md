# PROGRESS — the agent's memory

Append-only. Never edit old entries. Newest at the BOTTOM.
At the start of each session, read the "Decisions" section and the last 3 log entries.

## Decisions
(Choices not covered by the docs. One line each: date — decision — why.)

- 2026-10-25 — Flutter + Riverpod + decimal; engine is pure Dart in lib/core — testable, keeps UI dumb.
- 2026-10-25 — Project is `calculator` / org `com.hisaab` in this `hisaab/` folder (Android + iOS) — docs call the app "Calculator", org was unspecified.
- 2026-10-25 — `kotlin.incremental=false` in `android/gradle.properties` — pub cache is on C: and the project on D:, which breaks Kotlin's incremental caches ("different roots").

## Log

### T00 — Planning docs added — 2026-10-25
Status: DONE
Changed: AGENTS.md, docs/SPEC.md, docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/DESIGN.md, docs/TASKS.md, docs/PROGRESS.md
Tests: none yet
Notes for next session: Flutter project already created by the user. Start at T01.
Next: T01 Packages and skeleton

### T01 — Packages and skeleton — 2026-10-25
Status: DONE
Changed: created Flutter project (`calculator`, org `com.hisaab`, android+ios) in the existing folder; added flutter_riverpod, decimal, shared_preferences, http, intl, google_fonts; `lib/main.dart` (ProviderScope) + `lib/app.dart` (blank MaterialApp); all ARCHITECTURE folders under `lib/` and `test/` with `.gitkeep`; `test/app_test.dart`; `android/gradle.properties` (kotlin.incremental=false, see Decisions).
Tests: `test/app_test.dart` pumps the app and finds MaterialApp + Scaffold; `flutter test` 1/1 pass; `flutter analyze` no issues; `flutter build apk --debug` succeeds.
Notes for next session: the repo had only docs/ — the Flutter project did not actually exist yet, so T01 created it. No theme or tokens exist: T02 must add `lib/theme/app_tokens.dart` + `app_theme.dart` and wire `app.dart` to them.
Next: T02 Theme tokens
